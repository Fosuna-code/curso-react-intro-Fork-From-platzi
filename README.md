# What is this?
Hi there! This project is my first project in React.js, a ToDo app where you can manage all your tasks of the day. 
This app is a fork from a Platzi repository related to an online course where I learned the basics of React.js. What you're seeing here is my version of that project.


Any feedback is welcome :).


See the project working in this link:  https://fosuna-code.github.io/curso-react-intro-Fork-From-platzi/
 
# How it works?
I created this app using the "create react app" environment.


See the documentation here:  https://create-react-app.dev/.

Also, I organized this app by using the philosophy of feature-first.

Besides that, it is just a normal React app.
